By: Zach Welch, Camden Clements, and Adam Hodges
------------------------

Project Timeline
------------------------

Version 0.1
    - build network of peers/ultrapeers assuming no node will crash
    - display/monitor network topography using a visual graph

Version 0.2
    - nodes become actual computers. Nodes still don't crash but can be removed from network
    - tie in a share directory and gather files on client
    - develop search algorithm to traverse network from any starting node to search for filename

Version 0.3
    - design web user interface
    - extend graphing program to enhance testing (statistics, routetrace,...)
    - nodes fully scaleable and can crash
    - fetch found file

Version 0.4
    - enhance network structure (better algorithms)
    - extend testing features
    - enhance user interface

Version 0.5
    - file descriptions associated with files, search by keyword

Version 1.0
    - awesomeness
