PBJ - Please Be Jenerous
A Distributed File Sharing System
By: Zach Welch, Camden Clements, and Adam Hodges
------------------------

The PBJ client presents the user with access to our file sharing network.
Connected users can search, download, and share files across a distributed network.

Execution
------------------------

run gateway on specified gateway server (gecko22.cs.clemson.edu)
    gateway.py - latest stable version
    gateway_test.py - runs wx widget to display network graph image (buggy)

run pbj on client machine
    main.py - gui version of pbj
    dummy.py [share path] - runs pbj without gui (machines without wx)


Dependencies
------------------------
PBJ uses wxPython, the python module for wxWidgets (a powerful cross-platform GUI framework).
In order to run PBJ, wxPython must be installed. For information on downloading wx, see:
